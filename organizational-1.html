            The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an application of the IoT for medical and health related purposes,
            data collection and analysis for research, and monitoring.[38][39][40][41][42] The IoMT has been referenced
            as "Smart Healthcare",[43] as the technology for creating a digitized healthcare system, connecting
            available medical resources and healthcare services.
            IoT devices can be used to enable remote health monitoring and emergency notification systems. These health
            monitoring devices can range from blood pressure and heart rate monitors to advanced devices capable of
            monitoring specialized implants, such as pacemakers, Fitbit electronic wristbands, or advanced hearing aids.
            Some hospitals have begun implementing "smart beds" that can detect when they are occupied and when a
            patient is attempting to get up. It can also adjust itself to ensure appropriate pressure and support is
            applied to the patient without the manual interaction of nurses.[
            IoT devices "can save the United States more than $300 billion in annual healthcare expenditures by
            increasing revenue and decreasing cost."[47] Moreover, the use of mobile devices to support medical
            follow-up led to the creation of 'm-health', used analyzed health statistics.
