            Security is the biggest concern in adopting Internet of things technology,[196] with concerns that rapid
            development is happening without appropriate consideration of the profound security challenges involved[197]
            and the regulatory changes that might be necessary.[198][199]

            Most of the technical security concerns are similar to those of conventional servers, workstations and
            smartphones.[200] These concerns include using weak authentication, forgetting to change default
            credentials, unencrypted messages sent between devices, SQL injections, Man-in-the-middle attacks, and poor
            handling of security updates.[201][202] However, many IoT devices have severe operational limitations on the
            computational power available to them. These constraints often make them unable to directly use basic
            security measures such as implementing firewalls or using strong cryptosystems to encrypt their
            communications with other devices[203] - and the low price and consumer focus of many devices makes a robust
            security patching system uncommon.[204]

            Internet of Things devices also have access to new areas of data, and can often control physical
            devices,[205] so that even by 2014 it was possible to say that many Internet-connected appliances could
            already "spy on people in their own homes" including televisions, kitchen appliances,[206] cameras, and
            thermostats.[207] Computer-controlled devices in automobiles such as brakes, engine, locks, hood and trunk
            releases, horn, heat, and dashboard have been shown to be vulnerable to attackers who have access to the
            on-board network. In some cases, vehicle computer systems are Internet-connected, allowing them to be
            exploited remotely.[208] By 2008 security researchers had shown the ability to remotely control pacemakers
            without authority. Later hackers demonstrated remote control of insulin pumps[209] and implantable
            cardioverter defibrillators.
