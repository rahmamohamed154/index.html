            Monitoring and controlling operations of sustainable urban and rural infrastructures like bridges, railway
            tracks and on- and offshore wind-farms is a key application of the IoT.[64] The IoT infrastructure can be
            used for monitoring any events or changes in structural conditions that can compromise safety and increase
            risk. The IoT can benefit the construction industry by cost-saving, time reduction, better quality workday,
            paperless workflow and increase in productivity. It can help in taking faster decisions and save money with
            Real-Time Data Analytics. It can also be used for scheduling repair and maintenance activities in an
            efficient manner, by coordinating tasks between different service providers and users of these
            facilities.[46] IoT devices can also be used to control critical infrastructure like bridges to provide
            access to ships. Usage of IoT devices for monitoring and operating infrastructure is likely to improve
            incident management and emergency response coordination, and quality of service, up-times and reduce costs
            of operation in all infrastructure related areas.[71] Even areas such as waste management can benefit[72]
            from automation and optimization that could be brought in by the IoT.
