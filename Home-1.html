            The main concept of a network of smart devices was discussed as early as 1982, with a modified Coca-Cola
            vending machine at Carnegie Mellon University becoming the first ARPANET-connected appliance,
            able to report its inventory and whether newly loaded drinks were cold or not.
            Mark Weiser's 1991 paper on ubiquitous computing, "The Computer of the 21st Century", as well as academic
            venues such as UbiComp and PerCom produced the contemporary vision of the IOT.
            The concept of the "Internet of Things" and the term itself, first appeared in a speech by Peter T. Lewis,
            to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation 15th Annual Legislative Weekend in Washington, D.C, published
            in September 1985.
